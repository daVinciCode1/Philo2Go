      <h1>Kant's Categorial Imperative</h1>
      <h2>- by Kabir Sethi</h2>
      <p>Immanuel Kant is one of the most important philosophers of the 18th century and became famous for his contributions to moral philosophy, epistemology and metaphysics. In his most convincing ethical work - <em>Groundwork of Metaphysics of Morals</em>, Kant argues for an <em>a priori</em> (based in reason) conception of morality. Concluded famously by his categorical imperative, this ethical enquiry has withstood the test of time to become a defining theory in the unconcluded debate of good and evil. <br/> <br/>
      The underpinning philosophy that Kant uses to expand and reify his ethical framework is a rather liberal one: Kant asserts that a human agent must be rational and free of will to be able to make moral decisions one must solely operate “under the idea of freedom” (4:448). Having established such a fact, Kant introduces the notion of Duty as a direct consequence of the good-will, where only actions that were performed through a notion of duty can be of unquestionable good-will and have moral worth. Hence, duty can be understood as a motivation devoid of any personal sentiment; an action performed solely out of duty is synonymous to an action performed with the best intentions. This distinction is important, Kant was a deontologist, valuing intention over action. <br/> <br/>
      With this in mind, Kant formulated a universal law for ethical action in the form of a categorical imperative: “act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become universal law” (4:421). This categorical imperative summarizes a simple decision-making process that is as follows: <br/> <br/>
      1. Formulate a maxim that enshrines your reason for acting as you propose.</br>
      2. Recast the maxim as universal law of nature governing all rational agents.</br>
      3. Consider whether your maxim is conceivable in a world governed by such a law of nature.<br/>
      4. Question whether you could rationally will to act on your maxim in such a world. If you could act on such a maxim, then your action is morally permissible. <br/> <br/>
      Hence, we can redefine our understanding of a dutiful action, one that involves acting in accordance with the universal law. Per Kant, there are two fundamental ways in which a maxim could fail to pass the categorical imperative: either it fails to pass the third step, in which case it is a “perfect” duty, admitting “of no exception in favor of the inclination” – entailing a contradiction in conception, or it may fail the final step, in which case it is an “imperfect” duty requiring you to pursue a policy that can admit of such exceptions – entailing a contradiction in will (4:421). To illustrate the differences between “perfect” duties and “imperfect” duties let us consider examples for both cases. Let us consider an example of wanting to lie as a means of getting undue money, according to Kant’s categorical imperative, the maxim that one is acting upon is lying and hence, one could conceive of a universe in which lying is the natural law. <br/><br/>However, in such a universe, where everyone is lying, the endeavor is self-defeating, if everyone lies, there is no way of obtaining the truth and hence, a universe such as that could not exist; there is a contradiction in perception. In such a way, it is one’s perfect duty to not lie. Similarly, were we to consider the case of refusing to aid another so that one may focus on oneself, we notice that we are able to conceive of a universe in which one may refuse to aid another but one cannot rationally will to live or act on such a maxim constantly in the very same universe; there is a contradiction in will. Hence, refusing another’s aid is not categorically wrong but needs to be classified further depending on one’s inclinations. <br/> <br/>

      In a similar process, Kant redacted his formula in two more forms, making them more accessible to the rational agent depending on the circumstances. These became known respectively as the formula of humanity and friendship formula. <br/></p>
