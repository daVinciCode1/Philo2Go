      <h1>God is dead?</h1> <br/>
      <p> “Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly: ‘I seek God! I seek God!’?” <br/> <br/>

You might laugh at this point, just as the bystanders did in Nietzsche’s 1882 work <em>Die Fröhliche Wissenschaft</em> (The gay science). But what you just read is the setting to one of Nietzsche’s most famous quotes: <br /> <br/>

“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.” <br/> <br/>

The madman is clearly a means for the German philosopher to ridicule religion. But instead of capitalising on the meaninglessness of religion, as many of Nietzsche’s contemporaries did (Hegel and Schopenhauer amongst others), he enquires what can be done to substitute the meaning religion can give our lives in a world that rid itself from it.

Therefore, today we would like to explore why Nietzsche is in fact not a nihilist, as many have labeled him throughout the years, but rather an existentialist in his ideas on how humans can create meaning.

In order to achieve this, we have to take a close look at the lesser known aspect of the quote, namely when Nietzsche questions the murder of God from a moral perspective: <br/> <br/>

“Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become Gods simply to appear worthy of it?” <br/> <br/>


The first question entails a judgement of the crime based on the current dominating moral frameworks, namely religions. Murder, an action stemming from wrath, greed or envy is condemned in Christianity. Yet, with the death of the entity that justified the condemnation of such an action through that very same action, the moral judgement crumbles. God himself is the reason why Christians condemn the seven deadly sins. Hence, without God, there are no seven deadly sins.

This is where Nietzsche concludes in the second provocative question that we ourselves must fill in God’s shoes and create moral framework that judges the murder of god. With his idea of <em>Selbstüberwindung</em> (self-overcoming), Nietzsche would argue that this would be the opportunity for humans to rise above their circumstances and become <em>Übermenschen</em> (supermen). By facing the task of finding not only a new moral framework but also an existential order or in other words a meaning of life we would become, who we really are. <br/> <br/>


This overcoming is closely related to Nietzsche’s classification of moral frameworks. On the one hand, he defines a <em>Sklavenmoral</em> (slave morality) as religious frameworks that see virtues in refraining from exercising one’s powers. As an example, Christians would define sexlessness as “purity”, weakness as “goodness” and submission as “obedience”. Thus, Christians accept their position below God and submit to his very will in a fatalistic fashion, which in Nietzsche’s eyes is dishonest and life-negating. <br/> <br/>

On the other hand, Nietzsche proposes a <em>Herrenmoral</em> (master morality) that allows humans to embrace deadly sins envy, as it shows them what to aspire to and by a process of <em>Selbstüberwindung</em>, one’s possibilities to reach one’s goals become limitless.
<br/> <br/>

Thus, Nietzsche suggests, that by liberating ourselves from the <em>Sklavenmoral</em> that is propagated through Christianity, we receive the unique opportunity to fill life with meaning. Which is in itself, far from a nihilist perspective, as it does not denounce all meaning of life but rather existentialist in appealing to humans’ powers in shaping their own live’s meaning.

Nietzsche’s solution to the aftermath of a crime too great for humans judged by a <em>Sklavenmoral</em>, manifests itself in two intertwined ideas. <br/> <br/>

Firstly, he proposes <em>Amor Fati</em>, which is Latin for the love of life, but is better captured as the love of all nuances of life. Nietzsche wants humans to embrace all failures, hardships and tragedies just as much as successes, romances and wealth in their lives. <br/> <br/>

Secondly, as a test for <em>Amor Fati</em>, Nietzsche suggests that time might as well run circularly, not linearly. He named this phenomenon the Eternal Recurrence. Looking forward to leading the same life over and over again, for eternity, epitomises real love of life.

<br/> <br/>
Coming to a conclusion, “God is dead. […] And we have killed him.” is by no means a statement either of nihilist or atheist nature. Nietzsche is not praising a life void of meaning left by the fall of religious morality and worldview. He is reminding us all that we have the power to overcome ourselves and the slave morality of the past in order to rise above, love life for what it is and become who we really are - our best possible selves.
