      <h1>Plato's Cave Allegory</h1>
      <p> Today, we want to break down one of Plato's most well known thoughts- The Allegory of the Cave. Originally published in his work Republic, the Greek philosopher wrote this allegory as "a study of our nature with regard to <em>παιδεία</em> [education] and <em>απαιδεία</em> [the lack of it]"<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The story introduces a scenario in which prisoners have been chained in a cave their entire lives, facing the cave's wall and being unable to turn their heads. The only thing that they ever see and hear is shadows and echoes of the people and animals transversing past the well-lit entrance. Their perception of reality would thus be limited to such phenomena. As an example, if the prisoners would conversate about a shadow of a horse passing by, they would refer to the shadow as a "horse" while in reality a "horse" has a third dimension to it. <br/> <br/>Hence, Plato is disecting our use of language by enquiring whether our words capture reality itself or simply refer to our limited reality in which we are unaware of the true concept that we try to label.<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> <br/><br/>

      For the second part of the story, a prisoner is released, ascends out of the cave, and perceives reality for the first time in his life. He learns that shadows are in fact mere reflections of the real objects and gradually fathoms reality, particularly that the sun is the ultimate source of everything he falsely presumed to be real. Upon his return to the cave, the former prisoner shares his discovery with the captives yet struggles to understand their limited perspective. Through his time on the outside, his eyes had become accustomed to the light and cannot fully make out the shadows on the cave's wall anymore. This conflict with his former inmates escalates as they violently refuses his attempts to liberate them, thinking that he has gone mad.<br/><br/>

      Plato utilises this as an analogy for choosing the path of philosophy, as it aims to educate people that might not only be comfortable in their metaphorical shackles of ignorance, but possibly hostile to anyone attempting to liberate them.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a> This constitutes a tribute to Plato's mentor Sokrates, who was sentenced to death for disrupting the social order with his work.<a href="#4"><sup>4</sup></a>  <br/><br/>

      Despite its high age of almost 2400 years, the allegory proves to be timeless as it documents the most basic issues with our conception of reality and how philosophy can be a tool to discover the truest of realities. It also insists that one shares insights gained from philosophy with patience, as others might need the same amount of time to adjust to the new perception of reality as one did at first<a href="#5"><sup>5</sup></a>.  Plato implies that we might ourselves be shackled by ignorance due to circumstances that we have lived in our entire lives, such as social norms and human nature. Hence, the philosopher calls on people to question these circumstances and their perception of reality constantly in order to get one step closer to the truth. <br/> <br />

      Another interpretation suggests that Plato is building a case against his contemporary Athenian democracy as he deems the masses too ignorant to govern themselves.<a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a> In his scriptures, he argued that people rarley think for themselve, but rather join the popular opinion. This constitutes a fatal flaw in the democratic system, as unpopular opinions would hence be drowned by the majority. According to Plato, popular opinion is furthermore erroneous as it is based in biases, superstitions and social constrictions. In its place, he suggests the rule of philosopher kings in order to lead with reason and good example.<a href="#6"><sup>6</sup></a>  <br/> <br/>

      Which ever way you wish to decipher the hidden meaning behind Plato's Cave, it remains a strong testimony to the power of philosophy and the limitations of what we perceive as reality.
