      <h1>Cogito Ergo Sum</h1> <br/>
      <p>Have you ever felt like you couldn’t trust your sensory perception? Perhaps you have glimpsed at a looming shadow in your room one night, just to find out it was not a serial killer who fancied you for his next victim but rather an innocent pile of dirty clothes on a chair. <br/> <br/>
      This situation demonstrates the necessity of distrusting one’s senses. Any understanding even partly based on our oftentimes treacherous sense perception must be doubted in the eyes of many famous philosophers. <br/> <br/>
      Hence, 16th century philosopher René Descartes along with countless other rationalists sought to end our blind trust in our faulty senses<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>. His most famous statement “Cogito Ergo Sum” - I think therefore I am - is key in understanding his worldview of Cartesian Skepticism. <br/><br/>
      Descartes defines two key forms of doubt<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> as the reasoning behind his understanding of the world: <br/> <br/> <br/>
      <strong>1. Local Doubts</strong><br/> <br/>
      A dream might feel so real, one might mistake it for real life. Even flying seems so natural within the realms of imagination that one falls prey to the senses suggesting this truly occurs. However, this illusion shatters the instant one wakes up, clearly not being able to fly.  <br/><br/>
      In this situation, our doubts about a particular occurrence (flying) or sense perception (feeling of flying) are limited to a certain time span (our dream) thus being <em>local doubts</em>. <br/> <br/>
      <strong>2. Global Doubt</strong> <br /> <br/>
      Unfortunately, Descartes will not let us off the hook too easily. He questions our ability to state, whether life is just another dream. This would mean that any understanding gained during life would be as treacherous as the senses that helped us gain them in the first pace. <br/> <br/>
      Cartesian skepticism sees only one solution to this. One needs to dig down to the core of one’s every believes to uncover an indisputable belief. <br/> <br/>
      <br/>This indisputable belief is called the <em>foundational belief</em>. </span>Descartes identifies it as his ability to doubt his own existence. The mere fact that he is able to doubt his own life means that at least he is able to think. <em>Cogito Ergo Sum</em> is a testament to existence in a world where our own senses trick us into false understandings of it. <br/> <br/>
      From the foundational belief, Descartes deduces further believes arguing that they stem from a universal truth, hence being true as well. <br/> <br/>
      This is where our main concern with Cartesian Skepticism comes in: Just because the premise (foundational belief) is true, does not mean one’s conclusion (all other believes) is. This is called <em>deductive fallacy</em><a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Many philosophers argue that the French rationalist is able to deduct his mere existence, yet anything beyond that is to be doubted. <br/> <br/>
      Nevertheless, Descartes was able to fixate <em>Cogito Ergo Sum</em> as the axiom of his worldview, eventually deducing all beliefs that he had previously abandoned in search for his foundational belief. <br/< <br/></p>
