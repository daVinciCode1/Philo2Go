      <h1>Sartrean Existentialism</h1> <br/>
      <p>Jean-Paul Sartre is a famous French existentialist who authored several works of phenomenological ontology - philosophical studies of the structure of experiences and consciousness. <br/> <br/>

In his first novel “<em>La Nausée</em>” released in 1938, the author demonstrates situations in which the protagonist is alienated by the most common items in his everyday life. At one part, the hero Roquentin stops in a tram to reflect on the folly of a seat, its word’s strange sound as well as its given purpose. This reflection exemplifies Sartrean thinking as it aims to dismantle norms that construe our reality and instead focus on the absurdity of existence.<a href=#1><sup>1</sup></a> Why is it called a seat and not a table? Why can I not stand on the seat but have to sit?  <br/> <br/>

The odder life is, the more opportunities it harbours. But in Sartre’s eyes, this is more of a curse than a gift. He speaks of <em>angoisse</em> (anguish) of existence due to the staggering weight of countless opportunities with nothing holding a preordained purpose<a href=“#2”><sup>2</sup></a>. Humans assign purpose. If it pleases Roquentin, he might as well use the seat as a table or stand on it. <br/> <br/>

When observing the greater scale of life, matters are far more serious as decisions of career, partnership and happiness are within our own responsibility. One has to endure the fact that everything that is the status quo, is not the result of any other opportunities one has decided against. Particularly, in the face of what Sartre calls a finitude of important decisions in life, this can be even more frightening, given limitless possible regrets for only one outcome per a puny amount of decisions, limited by our brief lifespan<a href=#2><sup>2</sup></a>. <br/> <br/>

Sartre stresses the importance of living up to that responsibility and owning one’s decisions. Acts such as denying one’s own freedom in submitting to norms or diminishing the importance of the finite amount of decisions in life are part of what he calls <em>mauvaise fui</em> or bad faith. This often serves as an escape as it is more pleasant to surrender own responsibility than to make difficult decisions<a href=#3><sup>3</sup></a>. <br/> <br/>

Coming to a conclusion, Sartrean existentialism is best summarised with his mantra <em>Existence precedes Essence</em><a href=#2><sup>2</sup></a>. By reminding oneself of the absurdity of life (existence), one focuses on making decisions in one’s own life ultimately assigning purpose (essence).</p>
